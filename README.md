### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ridwan Rais!
This is my personal project that I've been working on for a week; a backend API for a YouTube clone website.

 I'm using Swagger 2.0 to create the API documentation as well as to generate the request and response structs, as well as the middleware for the handler. 

For the database, I use MongoDB because I've been using PostgreSQL and MySQL too much and want to use something different. I'm a little bit surprised because it's easier than expected to implement it!

Last but not least, I implement Clean Architecture paradigm to make the API more scalable and easier to maintain.

Frontend Repo: COMING SOON!
Deployed WebAPP: COMING SOON!
